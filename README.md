# 4x1_Array_26GHz_CDF
From the result of the measurement campagne of a 4x1 array antenna design in my other resposity, I analysed the beamforming capapility of the array in the present of human finger.

The simulations were done in prior:

The measurements including human parts were done using 3D scanner:

The results were shown in scanning gain of synthesised array:

The CDF of threshold gain show that the cover of fingers can be compensated if not so severe:
